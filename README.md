# Project 2
+ By: Rachel Dalby
+ Production URL: <http://p2.yourdomain.com>

## Outside resources
*Your list of outside resources go here*

## 3 Unique inputs
*You don't have to list all inputs, just 3 unique ones. The following is an example of what I'd put if my project was the xkcd Password Generator:*

1. *Text input to indicate number of words in password*
2. *Checkbox to indicate whether to include a number*
3. *Dropdown to indicate what symbol to include*

## Class
*List the name of the class(es) you're using, e.g. `Form.php`, `Password.php`, etc.*

## Code style divergences
I prefer to ues tab instead of spaces, it is what I am most comfortable with and can make sure is consistent.

## Notes for instructor
*Any notes for me to refer to while grading; if none, omit this section*
